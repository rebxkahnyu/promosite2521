      <div id="chara">my review</div>
      <p id="review">this show isn't my favorite show, but i think it's a great recommendation for first time k-drama viewers. it's got an amazing friend group, enemies to rivals to best friends, mommy issues, SPORTS (my favorite part), romance, humor, and it takes place in the 90s. to me, the actors are what appealed to me the most as i watched, as the cast is extremely talented. my favorite part of the show was the fencing matches, and i wish there was more of it alongside the friendship between the two female main characters. i've watched an amount of korean dramas that i am not proud of, and i think 2521 is one of the best out there. it even has a beach episode!<br><br>you can watch <i>twenty five twenty one</i> on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81517168?source=35">netflix</a>, or on the countless pirate websites.</p>
